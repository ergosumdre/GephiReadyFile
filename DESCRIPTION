Title: Generate Gephi Ready Social Media Networks using Twitter Data
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Dre Dyson
Maintainer: Dre Dyson <ergosumdre@gmail.com>
Description: This package will help users generate a Gephi ready csv file. We will ultize Twitter's
  API to search for tweets, given a user's search query. Then once we receive these tweets,
  this package will create a list of Usernames and Retweeter's usernames. From this list, we 
  build an adjacency list, which a Twitter User is a node, and a Retweet is an edge. This package
  then writes the adjacency list as a CSV that GEPHI recognizes and accepts as an input. 
  GEPHI is a Free and Open Source network visualization tool commonly used in Academia. 
  GEPHI allows you to explore, manipulate, and represent various techniques in Network Analysis.
